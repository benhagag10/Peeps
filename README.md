## What is Peeps?

Ever struggle to remember everyone you've met at conferences, collaborators from past projects, or researchers whose work intersects with yours? **Peeps** is a visual network tool that helps you map and track the people in your field.

Build your own knowledge graph of connections — who knows who, how they're related, what they work on — so you never lose track of valuable relationships.

## Features

- **Graph Canvas** — Drag, zoom, and pan through your network. Double-click anywhere to add someone new.
- **Smart Connections** — Drag between nodes to create links. People with shared streams or interests connect automatically.
- **Real-time Sync** — Collaborate with others. Changes sync instantly across all connected users.
- **Quick Search** — Find anyone instantly by name or affiliation with `⌘F`.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app
npm run dev
```

For the full experience with real-time sync, you'll also need to run the backend server. See `server/` for setup instructions.
